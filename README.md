**Carbon Fiber Skin Edit**
==========================

This is an edited version of Jason Harris **Carbon Fiber** skin [LINK](http://www.harrisj.net/xfire/skins/carbon-fiber/).

All credit for the base goes to him, except the XFire logo belongs to XFire.

This skin is a flat, dark skin for XFire, where I removed the side info panels, and extra buttons for adding friends, etc.  
All those features can be handled with either the menu or right-click context menu, if you were wondering.
